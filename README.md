## Clean Architecture

This architecture separates concerns into three distinct layers:

1. Domain Layer: Business logic (Entities, Use Cases, Repository Interfaces).
2. Data Layer: Data access (SQLite Implementation, Database connection).
3. Presentation Layer: User interaction (CLI Input/Output).
